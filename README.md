# Proj4-OOP-Game
Project 4-OOP game, for Team Treehouse FSJS course

I am submitting my Phrase Hunter game, for Exceeds.  I've included nine phrases to be chosen randomly.
I didn't like some of the button colors, so I changed a couple in the CSS styles.
Event Listeners are set on the initial start button, as well as the keyboard buttons, and the physical keyboard.
I added some colors to the different sections, as well as box shadow to onscreen keyboard buttons(all of these through Javascript).  This shadowing changes colors depending on whether the letter is in the phrase or not, after it is chosen.  
After a win or a loss, I change the "Start Game" button to say "New Game", as that's what's really happening.
